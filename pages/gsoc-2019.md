#### Student
Alexandra Livadas

#### Organization
[INCF](https:www.incf.org/) -- International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility

#### Project Title
Improve LORIS Automated Testing

#### Mentors
Christine Rogers, Shen, Krishna, Rida, MÃ©lanie, John

### Project Description and Overview

This project aims to improve the automated testing of the LORIS codebase and to set the LORIS team up for success in their testing in the future. This was accomplished by writing a large number of unit tests and by creating documentation that will help developers in the future. 

#### Deliverables
<dl>
<dt><span style="font-weight:normal">1. Familiarization with the LORIS codebase and its test suite.</span></dt>
<dd><small>This deliverable was mainly accomplished during the month of May.</small></dd>
<dt><span style="font-weight:normal">2. Improvements on the pre-existing code coverage and on the testability of the codebase.</span></dt>
<dd><small>This deliverable was accomplished throughout the coding period, specifically in any PRs listed below in which I 'added' to a library's unit tests.</small></dd>
<dt><span style="font-weight:normal">3. Add more tests to increase the pre-existing code coverage.</span></dt>
<dd><small>This deliverable was also accomplished throughout June, July, and August and is reflected in my testing-related PRs.</small></dd>
<dt><span style="font-weight:normal">4. Produce documentation to assist other developers in writing better tests and more "testable" code.</span></dt>
<dd><small>This deliverable was completed throughout the summer, but was focused on in August. The documentation can be viewed in the Documentation section below.</small></dd>

### My Summer Timeline
<dl>
<dt>May</dt>
<dd>My main focus throughout May was on setting up my LORIS and test development environment. I also took this time to get to know my mentors and create a detailed roadmap for the summer with their help. In order to familiarize myself with the LORIS workflow, I created a few very small, mostly documentation-related PRs. I also began to help with manual testing for the 21.0 release, which was a good way to learn about the LORIS codebase and about what automated testing was lacking.</dd>
<dt>June</dt>
<dd>Throughout June, I helped test the 21.0 release and  was assigned a couple modules to review and create issues for. I spent a lot of time working on my unit test environment set-up and on learning how to develop PHPUnit automated tests specifically for LORIS. I contributed my first three unit test PRs.</dd>
<dt>July</dt>
<dd>In July, I did the bulk of my testing-related coding. I opened five unit testing PRs throughout the month, which are listed below.</dd>
<dt>August</dt>
<dd>In August, my main focus was getting all of my open PRs reviewed, updated, and merged. I also created two more testing PRs. I also completed all my documentation.</dd>

### [July 30th Presentation](/assets/GSOC_Presentation.pdf)
On July 30th, I gave a presentation to the larger LORIS developer team, to update them on my progress and to let them know what I would be working on for the rest of the summer! I also went through some specific testing and "code smell" examples that I thought would be useful to them. It was a good way to get feedback on my work and to discuss potential tasks for August!

### My Overall Experience

This summer has been a truly amazing experience. I was lucky to be able to work in the office with the rest of the LORIS team rather than working remotely. This made communicating and working with the LORIS team a lot easier. It also made the summer that much more fun, since I was able to be a part of the team and get to know all of my mentors in person. I've learned a lot about PHP and automated testing in general. This project also gave me insight into what it is like to work on an open-source project in academia. This has been a wonderful summer and I feel as though I have gained a lot of experience and knowledge from my time as a GSOC student! 

Thank you so so much to all of my mentors and to the rest of the LORIS team for being so kind, supportive, and welcoming! I had a lot of fun :smile:
