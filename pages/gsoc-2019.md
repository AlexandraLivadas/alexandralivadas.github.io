### Project Title
Improve LORIS Automated Testing

### Mentors
Christine Rogers, Shen Wang, Krishna Chatpar, Rida Abou-Haidar, Melanie Legault, John Saigle

### Project Description and Overview

This project aims to improve the automated testing of the LORIS codebase and to set the LORIS team up for success in their testing in the future. This was accomplished by writing a large number of unit tests and by creating documentation that will help developers in the future. 

#### Deliverables
1. Familiarization with the LORIS codebase and its test suite.
2. Improvements on the pre-existing code coverage and on the testability of the codebase. 
3. Add more tests to increase the pre-existing code coverage.
4. Produce documentation to assist other developers in writing better tests and more "testable" code.

### [July 30th Presentation](/assets/GSOC_Presentation.pdf)
On July 30th, I gave a presentation to the larger LORIS developer team, to update them on my progress and to let them know what I would be working on for the rest of the summer! I also went through some specific testing and "code smell" examples that I thought would be useful to them. It was a good way to get feedback on my work and to discuss potential tasks for August!

### My Overall Experience

This summer has been a truly amazing experience. I was lucky to be able to work in the office with the rest of the LORIS team rather than working remotely. This made communicating and working with the LORIS team a lot easier. It also made the summer that much more fun, since I was able to be a part of the team and get to know all of my mentors in person. I've learned a lot about PHP and automated testing in general. This project also gave me insight into what it is like to work on an open-source project in academia. This has been a wonderful summer and I feel as though I have gained a lot of experience and knowledge from my time as a GSOC student! 

Thank you so so much to all of my mentors and to the rest of the LORIS team for being so kind, supportive, and welcoming!
