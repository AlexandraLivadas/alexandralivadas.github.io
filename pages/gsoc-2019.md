### Project Title

Improve LORIS Automated Testing

### Project Description and Overview

This project aims to improve the automated testing of the LORIS codebase and to set the LORIS team up for success in their testing in the future. This was accomplished by writing a large number of unit tests and by creating documentation that will help developers in the future. 

#### Deliverables
1. Familiarization with the LORIS codebase and its test suite.
2. Improvements on the pre-existing code coverage and on the testability of the codebase. 
3. Add more tests to increase the pre-existing code coverage.
4. Produce documentation to assist other developers in writing better tests and more "testable" code.
