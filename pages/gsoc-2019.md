### Organization
INCF

### Project Title
Improve LORIS Automated Testing

### Project Description and Overview

This project aims to improve the automated testing of the LORIS codebase and to set the LORIS team up for success in their testing in the future. This was accomplished by writing a large number of unit tests and by creating documentation that will help developers in the future. 

#### Deliverables
1. Familiarization with the LORIS codebase and its test suite.
2. Improvements on the pre-existing code coverage and on the testability of the codebase. 
3. Add more tests to increase the pre-existing code coverage.
4. Produce documentation to assist other developers in writing better tests and more "testable" code.

### [July 30th Presentation](/assets/GSOC_Presentation.pdf)
On July 30th, I gave a presentation to the larger LORIS developer team, to update them on my progress and to let them know what I would be working on for the rest of the summer! I also went through some specific testing and "code smell" examples that I thought would be useful to them. It was a good way to get feedback on my work and to discuss potential tasks for August!
