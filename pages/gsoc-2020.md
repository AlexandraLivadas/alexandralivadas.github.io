## Google Summer of Code 2020 Work Product Submission
_August 31, 2020_

#### Student
Alexandra Livadas

#### Organization
[INCF](https://www.incf.org/) -- International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility

#### Project Title
[LORIS](http://loris.ca/) Automated Testing

#### Mentors
Christine Rogers, Shen Wang

### Project Description and Overview
The aim of this project is to improve the automated testing code coverage of the LORIS codebase. Another aim is to make improvements to the RaisinBread database and to develop a code coverage reporting tool to make automated tests easier to implement. _This project is a continuation of my Google Summer of Code project last summer, where the aim was to improve the unit testing coverage of the LORIS codebase._ 

This was accomplised throughout the summer by writing both unit and integration tests for some of the core libraries and modules. The RaisinBread dataset was improved on by both addressing specific issues reported by other developers and going through the database itself and ensuring that the data was accurate and useful for running automated and manual tests. Finally, code coverage metrics were calculated throughout the summer in the form of an Excel spreadsheet, and the PHPUnit code coverage tool was configured and set up to work for LORIS. **The last line needs work**

#### My Deliverables
This is a list of the deliverables my mentors and I set for myself at the beginning of the project. 

1. Complete unit testing coverage for core libraries that lacked significant coverage. 
2. Add integration testing coverage for core modules that did not have baseline coverage. 
3. Improve upon the RaisinBread dataset by both fixing inconsistent data and adding more data for tables and modules that were lacking.
4. Develop a tool or system to easily calculate the LORIS code coverage metrics. 
5. Write documentation throughout the summer related either to general LORIS coding practice and development information or to automated testing specifically. **needs re-wording**

#### Summer Timeline
##### May - Early June
The first quarter of the summer was spent re-acquainting myself with the LORIS codebase and the automated testing that was already in place. I also helped in the release testing process for the most recent release of LORIS (23.0). This involved manually testing 6 modules and creating both issues and PRs to report on and fix any bugs or major errors that I encountered. Another main focus of this period was documentation. Along with the two other Google Summer of Code students working with LORIS, I started working on the LORIS Cheatsheet, a document containing useful information for LORIS developers about the install process and the general workflow of LORIS. This document eventually evolved into the LORIS Developer's Guide, which was finalized at the end of the summer. I contributed to other documentation as well, namely updating many of the publicly available markdowns on GitHub that were updated for the 23.0 release. **too long**

##### Mid June - Mid July
This period was mainly spent developing unit tests for core LORIS libraries. _After discussion with my mentors, it was determined that the unit testing coverage as of the beginning of the summer was not sufficient and that this should take priority over integration test development._ I completed unit testing coverage for 7 core libraries in total. The related PRs are listed below. 

##### Mid July - August
After I made significant headway on unit testing coverage, the remaining time was spent focusing on integration testing and improving RaisinBread. It was decided that I would focus on completing baseline coverage for about 6 modules that lacked any integration testing. During this time, I also addressed specific issues related to the RaisinBread dataset that were causing issues when developers tried to manually test a module. _I went through the entirity of the RaisinBread dataset and performed "sanity checks" to make sure that all the data being used to test LORIS was accurate and condusive to manually testing the modules._ I configured the PHPUnit code coverage tool to work with LORIS and developed a separate script that edits the reports to display information relevant to internal developers. Finally, in the last weeks of August, I created a finalized version of the LORIS Developer's Guide that was started at the beginning of the project and added it to the publicly available documents on the LORIS repository.

### [My July 28th Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13-NGAn7sJSqOfM19iyXBeyOrk8iFa_uEFE9nRaDywI0/edit?usp=sharing)
I gave this presentation to the LORIS development team on July 28th. I presented the progress I had made in my project at this point of the summer. I gave an overview of the current LORIS code coverage metrics and discussed the documentation and tools I was developing to keep track of code coverage metrics. 

### My Experience
I am very proud of the work that I was able to accomplish throughout this summer with my mentors. Since I had worked with the LORIS team last summer as well, I was very honoured and glad to be working with everyone again. As always, the LORIS team and my two mentors were very kind and supportive throughout the process and offered a lot of help and feedback that was very appreciated. The work was challenging at times but very interesting, and I definitely gained some new skills and knowledge over the course of the summer. I also enjoyed having two other GSOC students working for LORIS this summer. It was nice to have other people in a similar position to mine that I could bounce ideas off of and get help if I needed any!

I would like to thank my mentor Christine and also Shen Wang for their help throughout the project. Thank you to the entire LORIS and INCF team for everything, I had a really wonderful experience!
